<ul>
<li>Voltage across the diode is read by A1.</li>
<li>The current is obtained by dividing (PV1 - A1) by the resistance.</li>
<li>The voltage at PV1 is incremented by steps and at each step the voltage acrossthe diode is measured.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>



<hr>
<p>For diode in forward biased</p>
<ul>
<li>Make connections, use 1N4148 to start with, and press <strong>START</strong>. </li>
<li>Use the save data button to export plot points </li>
<li>Use different color LEDs and repeat the experiment.</li>

<h3>Zener Diode</h3>

<p>
        <p><img src="images/DiodeGraph.png" alt="" height="300"></p>
        Expected graph for Zener Diode. The graph in the first quadrant represents the characteristics
        for forward biased mode and the graph in the third quadrant represents the reverse biased mode
        </p>


<ul>
    <li>Make the connections similar to the schematic. But remember that the side with the black
        notch in the zener diode is the (-) or N side. 
    </li>

<hr>
ZenerDiode in forward biased mode
<ul>
<li>
    Make connections according the schematic and follow the same procedure as you did for 1N4148 or LEDs 
</li>
</ul>
ZenerDiode in reverse biased mode
<ul>
<li>
Once the plot for forward biased mode is plotted, flip the diode in circuit. The black notch should be at the positive terminal (attached to A1) and 
the other end should be attached to GND

</li>
<li>
    Click the start button and follow the procedure as before
</li>
</ul>
